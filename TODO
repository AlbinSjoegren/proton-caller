# TODO

This is a list of To-Do actions for continual development or Proton Caller.
If you believe features should be added to Proton Caller in the future, create
a pull request and add it to this list, or an issue in the same format. They 
will be reviewed and added to this list if they are valid features to have.

## How to contribute to the list
Keep each list item in an organized layout:

    X. Simple name for features
        A. Things included within the feature
        ...

    An explination for why the feature is needed, what it will be used for and
    any ideas on how to implement the feature.


(and two empty lines below)

Any feature requests that do not follow this layout will not be reviewed.
Completed actions will be added to a separete file (COMPLETED) and explained
in the release (and commit) they were added in.


1.  Check for executable existance
        A. Check for Proton
        B. Check for Windows executable
    
    This would keep the program from executing programs that do not exist on
    the drive.


2.  Pass arguments to executable
        A. Pass arguments to Windows executable
        B. Dynamically change the amount of arguments passed to allow this 
        feature to be added.

    Make it possible to launch programs which need specific command line
    arguments to execute using Proton Caller. This is needed because many games
    and game launchers DO NOT run without spcial arguments. Some may want to
    use this to also force games to run in different graphics APIs 
    (OpenGL, Vulkan).
