# TODO

This is a list of To-Do actions for continual development or Proton Caller.
If you believe features should be added to Proton Caller in the future, create
a pull request and add it to this list, or an issue in the same format. They 
will be reviewed and added to this list if they are valid features to have.

## How to contribute to the list
Keep each list item in an organized layout:

    X. Simple name for features
        A. Things included within the feature
        ...

    An explination for why the feature is needed, what it will be used for and
    any ideas on how to implement the feature.


(and two empty lines below)

Any feature requests that do not follow this layout will not be reviewed.
Completed actions will be added to a separete file (COMPLETED) and explained
in the release (and commit) they were added in.


1.  config file for paths and default

    A. include and use library to parse config files
    B. Have paths to steam's common
    C. Have path to a default version
    D. choose default version if none listed

    Remove the need for confusing and inconsistant environment variables

2.  As said above, default proton version
